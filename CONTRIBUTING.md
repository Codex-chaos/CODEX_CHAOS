# How to Contribute to the Trilogy of Will

We welcome contributions, but we are not a democracy. This is a meritocracy of the mind.

## Bug Reports (Opening an Issue)

If you find a logical flaw, a weak argument, or a contradiction within the texts, you can open an "Issue". Please use the following format:
*   **Title:** A clear and concise description of the bug (e.g., "The 'Two Suns' protocol in Ars Ritualia contradicts the 'Lone Wolf' principle in the Codex").
*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of why you think it's a bug.
*   **Proposed Fix:** How would you refactor this concept to make it stronger?

## Pull Requests (Submitting a "Patch")

If you have a new **"Field Note"**, a powerful real-world example of a protocol in action, or a suggestion for a new **"Interlude"**, you can submit a Pull Request.
Your submission will be reviewed. If its quality and style match the core of the project, it may be merged.

**Code of Conduct:** We expect absolute intellectual honesty. No ad hominem attacks. Attack the idea, not the person. Trolls and "concern trolls" will be banned without warning. This is a forge, not a safe space.
